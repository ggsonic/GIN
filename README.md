# some important thoughts

* HPP why we name it HPP? It is different from embeddings. The basic element is state or node with acting edges or branches,with each branch with  a particular context. Deep Learning Models can learn individual embeddings, but HPP is  learned from contextual related environment.

* The process of Neural Knowledge Compression do similar things like encoding HPPs. Input horizontal sequence-to-sequence HPPs, NKC got output one HPP with branch-to-branch forward graph, a.k.a a new HPP graph. NKC keep running when sleeping, with brain's memory space freed and got deeper knowledge and wisdom
